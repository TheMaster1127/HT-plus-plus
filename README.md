# HT++

HT++ is a statically-typed programming language that transpiles to C++. It features an AutoHotkey (AHK)-like syntax with static types, combining ease of use with the performance and power of C++. This allows for the development of efficient and versatile scripts that can run on any device where C++ is supported, ensuring compatibility across every platform.
